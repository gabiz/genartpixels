- Secure handle creation with user validation

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **UserProfile Component**: 8 test cases covering display, interactions, and edge cases
- **HandleSelection Component**: 12 test cases covering validation, submission, and error states
- **UserSettings Component**: 13 test cases covering profile updates, quota display, and account actions
- **API Route**: 7 test cases covering success, error, and edge cases

### Test Coverage
