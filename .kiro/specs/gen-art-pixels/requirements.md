# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Gen Art Pixels is a collaborative digital canvas platform where users create, share, and evolve pixel-based artworks called frames. Each frame serves a purpose — to express ideas, support causes, or tell stories — while growing as multiple contributors add pixels over time. The platform enables real-time exploration of frames with zoom capabilities, social interactions through likes and contributor stats, and sharing via unique URLs. A quota system encourages steady, collaborative participation while highlighting creativity, community engagement, and meaningful expression.

## Requirements

5. WHEN a user clicks on a pixel THEN the system SHALL display the contributor's handle
6. WHEN a user views a frame THEN the system SHALL display frame stats including contributors count, pixels placed, likes, and leaderboard positions
7. WHEN a user wants to share a frame THEN the system SHALL provide a unique URL in format /userHandle/frameHandle

6. WHEN a handle is successfully created THEN the system SHALL associate it with the user's account permanently

### Requirement 3: Frame Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to create new frames with specific settings, so that I can initiate collaborative art projects.

5. WHEN creating a frame THEN the system SHALL default to Core Frame (128×128) size selection
6. WHEN creating a frame THEN the system SHALL allow setting permissions: open, approval-required, or owner-only
7. WHEN a frame is created THEN the system SHALL assign ownership to the creator
8. WHEN a frame is created THEN the system SHALL make it publicly accessible via URL format /userHandle/frameHandle
9. WHEN a frame owner wants to modify permissions THEN the system SHALL allow permission changes at any time
10. WHEN a frame owner wants to freeze a frame THEN the system SHALL prevent further pixel placement
11. WHEN a frame owner wants to unfreeze a frame THEN the system SHALL allow pixel placement to resume
12. WHEN a frame is in approval-required mode THEN the system SHALL allow the owner to invite contributors by handle
13. WHEN a frame is in approval-required mode THEN the system SHALL allow users to request edit permissions
14. WHEN users request edit permissions THEN the system SHALL display pending requests to the frame owner
15. WHEN a frame owner wants to block a user THEN the system SHALL prevent that user from placing pixels by providing their handle
16. WHEN a frame owner identifies problematic contributions THEN the system SHALL allow removal of specific user contributions

### Requirement 4: Pixel Placement and Quota System

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to place pixels on frames with a fair quota system, so that I can contribute to collaborative art while ensuring balanced participation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any pixel location THEN the system SHALL display a color palette with 16 color options including transparent
2. WHEN a user selects a color and confirms placement THEN the system SHALL check available pixel quota only if the pixel state will change
3. IF the user has available quota AND the pixel state will change THEN the system SHALL place the pixel and decrement the quota by 1
4. IF the user has no available quota THEN the system SHALL display quota exhausted message with refill time
5. WHEN a user places a pixel THEN the system SHALL provide satisfying visual feedback
6. WHEN a user wants to undo their last pixel THEN the system SHALL allow one-level undo functionality
7. WHEN an hour passes THEN the system SHALL refill user quota up to 100 pixels maximum
8. WHEN a user views their quota status THEN the system SHALL display current available pixels and time until next refill

### Requirement 5: Social Features and Engagement

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to like frames and see engagement metrics, so that I can interact with the community and discover popular content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user views a frame THEN the system SHALL display a like button
2. WHEN a user clicks the like button THEN the system SHALL increment the frame's like count
3. WHEN a user has already liked a frame THEN the system SHALL show the liked state and allow unliking
4. WHEN a user encounters offensive content THEN the system SHALL provide a report button
5. WHEN a user reports content THEN the system SHALL log the report for moderation review
6. WHEN viewing frame stats THEN the system SHALL display total contributors, pixels placed, likes, creation date, and last activity
7. WHEN viewing the main dashboard THEN the system SHALL show most active frames (daily/weekly), fastest growing frames, and frames with most pixels
8. WHEN any user (including viewers) wants to search for frames THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality using title, description, and keywords

### Requirement 6: Real-time Collaboration

**User Story:** As a user viewing a frame, I want to see live updates as other users add pixels, so that I can experience the collaborative nature of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user places a pixel THEN the system SHALL broadcast the update to all viewers of that frame in real-time
2. WHEN a user is viewing a frame THEN the system SHALL receive and display pixel updates from other users immediately
3. WHEN multiple users are editing simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent pixel placement without conflicts
